# yara-action-demo

Super simple example using github actions of taking a list of yara rules, then combining them into a single file and re-pushing that ruleset.

# TODO

 - Make actions so concatenation only happens on a PR
 - Test yara signatures prior to combining
 - Reject/Notate PR on test fail
 - Document action setup
